// paint the upload screen and then swap to the plan (a visible flash and a layout shift). This runs before the
// app is parsed: it hides the app until the plan is on screen (SightWorkFlow removes the class), and never for
// more than 2.5 s, so a script error can't leave the page blank. (`?view=example` is prerendered instead, see
// next.config.ts.) If the script ever sees view=example here (rewrite not applied), it hides the swap too.
