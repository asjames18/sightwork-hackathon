/**
 * SightWork pipeline step: `reason`.
 *
 * Takes the sampled frames, the SAM segmentation result, and the
 * narration transcript, and turns them into the ranked-issues / work-plan
 * part of a WorkPlan (prompt 03 spec).
 *
 * This module makes no API calls and holds no keys. The model caller is
 * injected by the wiring code (later: src/lib/meta), so the step is
 * testable on mock data and the spike can swap callers without touching
 * this logic. Every would-be call is recorded on the usage tracker from
 * ./usage.ts, so the $10 spike cap is enforced in code.
 *
 * Prompt and schema are injected too: they come from the prompt 03
 * spec, not from this module. The schema is normalized before it is
 * sent: local `#/$defs/*` references are inlined, because structured
 * output may not accept `$ref`. `anyOf` is passed through as written;
 * if the provider rejects it, the caller surfaces that error verbatim
 * and the step fails loudly instead of guessing.
 *
 * Post-processing (all in the prompt file, enforced here, not trusted
 * to the model):
 * - drop issues with confidence < 0.5; an unmentioned issue needs >= 0.6;
 *   issues from 0.35 up to the bar move to `watch` instead of dropping,
 *   and a null coverageNote is normalized to omitted
 * - re-number ranks 1..n with no gaps, remapping every rank reference
 *   (materials forIssues, workOrder fixes, saidVsSeen issueRank)
 * - drop saidVsSeen rows for dropped issues
 * - drop total/subtotal inventory rows whose count equals the sum of the
 *   same base label's zone rows (prompt 03 rule 7; IMG_9140 double-count guard)
 * - validate with checkWorkPlan from ../types, plus a frameTimeSec check
 *   against the input frames. On failure, retry once with the errors
 *   appended to the prompt. If neither attempt validates cleanly but
 *   at least one parsed and passed the shape check, return the better
 *   result (fewer validation errors, first wins ties) with those
 *   errors on `warnings` instead of failing the run; throw only when
 *   neither attempt gives a schema-valid result (2026-10-27
 *   9:55 AM review). The runner logs the warnings server-side.
