/**
 * SightWork pipeline step: `renderAfter`.
 *
 * Takes the WorkPlan from the reason step (prompt 03) and produces the
 * "after" image: a Muse Image edit of the hero frame showing only the
 * finished, visible work (prompt 04
 * spec).
 *
 * This module makes no API calls and holds no keys. The image caller is
 * injected by the wiring code (later: src/lib/meta), so the step is
 * testable on mock data and the spike can swap callers without touching
 * this logic. Every would-be call is recorded on the usage tracker from
 * ./usage.ts, so the $10 spike cap is enforced in code.
 *
 * Rules (prompt 04, enforced here, not trusted to the model):
 * - Hero frame: plan.heroFrameIndex when set and in range; otherwise the
 *   frameIndex of the highest-ranked issue whose fix is visible; otherwise
 *   the frame closest to the middle of the video. Whatever is picked is
 *   returned as heroFrameIndex so the wiring can write it back to the
 *   plan and the UI shows the right "before" frame. If the picked frame
 *   has no visible changes, the step falls back to the highest-ranked
 *   issue frame that does (recomputing the changes) before skipping:
 *   a reason step that points at a frame with nothing to fix must not
 *   silently drop the after image when a ranked issue frame has work.
 * - Visible changes only: issues that appear in the hero frame
 *   (frameIndex or a proof frame), and only the work steps that fix them
 *   and describe something seen (paint, cables, chairs, lights, signs,
 *   tiles). Inspections and hidden work (inside walls, above ceilings)
 *   are skipped. If the list is empty, no model call is made.
 * - Failure returns null: on any model failure the step returns
 *   afterImageUrl null, because the UI already has a placeholder slot.
 *   A judge failure is the exception: the optional judge only picks
 *   between two good candidates, so a bad judge answer keeps the first
 *   candidate instead of discarding a valid image.
 *   A billed judge failure is recorded on the tracker before that
 *   fallback, so the route total counts it; a tracker throw on the
 *   record is warned, not a spending stop, as in the review step.
 * - afterImageUrl is null (never omitted or an empty string) when the
 *   image is skipped or fails, and afterImageLabel is set only when an
 *   image exists, per the plan-screen contract.
 *
 * Model IDs are not hardcoded here: prompt 04 says to confirm them at
 * the first spike, so the wiring supplies imageModel (and judgeModel
 * when the judge runs) through deps.
 *
 * Fail-fast validation (same series as reason.ts): the input shape is
 * validated before any work, and the call deps are validated after the
 * skip checks but before any paid Image call, so a bad request never
 * spends a call. A bad request throws with a clear reason: error; the
 * skip paths (no frames, no visible changes, unusable hero URL) still
 * return null without needing valid call deps, because no call is made.
