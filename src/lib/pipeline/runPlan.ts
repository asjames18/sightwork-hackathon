/**
 * SightWork pipeline runner: one PlanRequest in, one WorkPlan out.
 *
 * Stage order, matched to the UI steps in types.ts:
 *   listening (transcribe) -> looking + counting (segment) ->
 *   comparing (reason) -> planning (cost + assembly) ->
 *   picturing (renderAfter) -> reviewing (review, optional).
 * Reviewing is review-only and never fails a run: it checks the
 * finished plan against its proof photos and lands on plan.review.
 * Transcribe is optional the same way: a failed transcribe call
 * continues without narration and sets meta.skipped.transcribe,
 * so a flaky ASR call costs the said-vs-seen part, not the plan.
 * The route emits the first "uploading" status itself, right after it
 * parses the body; this runner starts at "listening".
 *
 * The runner makes no Meta calls itself. Every model call goes through
 * a caller injected in the step deps, and every call is recorded on
 * the shared tracker, which enforces the spike cap in code.
 *
 * Failures throw PlanStepError: a pipeline step plus a plain message
 * (no provider error text, no model output), so the route can stream
 * it straight to the UI as { state: "failed", step, message }. The
 * internal detail rides on PlanStepError.detail for the server log
 * only, never for the UI. An aborted signal throws an AbortError
 * instead, so the route can just close the stream.
 *
 * Per-request prompt seam: prompts 03/05 carry per-request variables
 * (frames, transcript, region), so a static dep prompt cannot fill
 * them. The route may pass reasonPrompt / costPrompt builders on
 * RunPlanDeps instead; when present, the built prompt replaces the
 * static dep prompt for that run (including the reason retry, which
 * reuses the step prompt). When absent, the static prompt is used
 * unchanged. The seam lives here, not in the step deps, because this
 * runner already assembles both step inputs. The review prompt works
 * the same way: reviewPrompt builds prompt 06 from the finished plan
 * (its issues and selected proof photos), and the route supplies the
 * review caller alongside it.
