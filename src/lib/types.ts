/**
 * SightWork plan output format: the shared contract between the frame

 * routes, and the UI. Mock data and the real pipeline must both match it.
 *
 * Conventions
 * - Times are seconds from the start of the video (`...Sec`).
 * - `frameIndex` is the position in the plan's `frames` array (0-based),
 *   which is also the order frames are attached to the reasoning call.
 * - Boxes are normalized 0-1000 as [x1, y1, x2, y2] (Muse Spark / SAM style).
 * - Money is USD. Every cost is an estimate and carries its label.
